At this point, you need to use the fast api main app to process payments and usage.

Use the following 3 components:

1. fastapi-magnum-prod (top1fz1igk)
2. pathx.js file /home/getdiyai/public_html/wp-content/plugins/Variant-WP-Page-Builder-master/js/pathx.js
3. local fast api app that you can debug with ngrok:
    /Users/clifforddalsoniii/Documents/Brightforest/projects/production/lambda_endpoints/main_fastapi
4. ngrok -- /Users/clifforddalsoniii/Documents/Brightforest/utils

5. Use the wp_data object to process the payments. 

This allows for the use of multisite since there is no wp user front end dependency.
